<h1>Help!</h1>

<p>
Use Clearmind to map out and organize your thoughts.
</p>

<p>3 easy steps:</p>

<ul>
<li>Mark down a though.</li>
<li>Break that thought down into sub-thoughts.</li>
<li>Repeat.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are more tools to help you organize your thoughts:</p>

<ul>
<li>Copy, Paste, or Drag thoughts.</li>
<li>Export your whole thought tree as a text file for safe keeping.</li>
<li>Create hyperlinks to relate two thougths (no you can't do that yet).</li>
</ul>

<p>Thank you for using Clearmind</p>
